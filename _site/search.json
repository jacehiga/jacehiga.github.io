Player data was scraped daily using Python and the nba_api package, saved in JSON format, and uploaded to Railway. SQL queries were used to process and insert the data into structured tables. The processed data was then analyzed, and a dashboard was built in Grafana to visualize trends and support informed decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MLB Data Acquisition \n\n\nStack: SQL • Python • Selenium • API Scraping • Railway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This MLB Data Acquisition project utilizes two automated scrapers, one built with Selenium to extract data from MLB.com, and the other leveraging the statsapi package for structured statistics. The collected data is stored in JSON format, deployed via Railway, and systematically ingested into a PostgreSQL database for analysis.\n\n → More detailed overview \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Datafest: Legal Data Analysis \n\n\nStack: R • tidyverse • Textual Analysis • tidytext • ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  During this 48-hour DataFest competition, I performed exploratory data analysis using the tidyverse package in R. I also applied the tidytext package to extract insights through textual analysis. To enrich our findings, I conducted external research and integrated supplemental data sources. I then used ggplot2 to create compelling visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Gender Wage Gap Dashboard \n\n\nStack: R • tidyverse • RShiny • ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Over the course of this project, my partner and I explored gender-based wage disparities. After performing exploratory data analysis, we summarized our key findings in an interactive dashboard built with R Shiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Spelling Bee Word Generator \n\n\nStack: JavaScript • Observable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This project involves the development of a solver tool for The New York Times “Spelling Bee” game. Users input a set of letters, and the tool generates a table of valid words, sorted by length with the longest words prioritized. The output also includes a dynamic word cloud, where words longer than seven letters are highlighted in bold and pangrams (words that use all available letters) are distinguished in teal for quick recognition."
